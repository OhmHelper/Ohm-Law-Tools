    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><em>Last updated: <span id="lastUpdated">2025-11-20</span></em></p>

    <p>
      This Privacy Policy describes how the website
      <strong>Lab Calculators / Ohm-Law-Tools</strong>
      (accessible at <code>https://ohmhelper.github.io/Ohm-Law-Tools/</code>)
      handles information when you use the site.
    </p>

    <h2>1. What this site does</h2>
    <p>
      This site provides free electronics and physics calculators. You can use
      the tools directly in your browser. You do not need to create an account
      or log in, and the site does not ask you to submit personal information.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Information collected automatically</h2>
    <p>
      The site is hosted by GitHub Pages. Like most web services, the hosting
      provider may automatically collect basic technical information in server
      logs, such as:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>IP address and approximate region</li>
      <li>Browser type and version</li>
      <li>Operating system</li>
      <li>Referring page (the link you clicked to get here)</li>
      <li>Date and time of access</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This information is generally used for security, abuse prevention, and
      aggregate statistics (for example, how many people visit the site).
      I do not personally attempt to identify individual users.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Cookies and local storage</h2>
    <p>
      The calculators themselves do not intentionally set cookies or store
      personal data. Your browser may store basic preferences or cache files
      to make the site load faster. If you prefer, you can clear your browser
      cache and cookies at any time through your browser settings.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Third-party services and ads</h2>
    <p>
      In the future, this site may use third-party services such as
      <strong>Google AdSense</strong> or analytics tools to display ads or
      understand how the site is used. These services may use cookies or
      similar technologies to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Measure page views and traffic patterns</li>
      <li>Detect fraud or misuse</li>
      <li>Show more relevant ads</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      If and when such services are enabled, their data collection and use will
      also be governed by their own privacy policies. For example, Google’s
      policies are available at
      <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
        https://policies.google.com/privacy
      </a>.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Links to other sites</h2>
    <p>
      The site may contain links to external websites (for example, datasheets,
      documentation, or product pages). I am not responsible for the content or
      privacy practices of those third-party sites. Please review their privacy
      policies separately.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Data security</h2>
    <p>
      This site is served over HTTPS, which helps protect data in transit
      between your browser and the server. However, no method of transmission
      over the internet is perfectly secure, so you should avoid entering
      sensitive personal information into any calculator or free-form field.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Use by children</h2>
    <p>
      This site is intended for general educational use and is not specifically
      directed at children under the age of 13. If you are a parent or guardian
      and believe your child has provided personal information through this
      site, you can contact me using the email below.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
      I may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When changes are made,
      the “Last updated” date at the top of this page will be revised. Your
      continued use of the site after any update means you accept the new
      version.
    </p>

    <h2>9. Contact</h2>

      information, you can contact:
